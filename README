Tipi

What is It?

I run a lot of different Ruby/Rails and PHP apps on my Mac at once. I'd prefer to not have to think about firing up 'rails s' one at a time or various flavors of remembering different ports and whatnot. Using the Rails convention of /public as the webroot for a given project, this tool just looks through your ~/github directory and makes host entries and vhost apache conf files if it finds a /public directory. Obviously you'll need to turn on your cgi engine of choice, but I've found php5_module coexists nicely with passenger_module.

This is super-hackish right now and will only work if your username is 'nathan' but I promise to clean it up in subsequent builds. Patches welcome, of course.

----------

0) Get organized and keep all your software projects in ~/github/

1) sudo Add this line to the end of /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:

	Include /Users/YOURUSERNAME/github/tipi/public/*.conf
	
2) (Edit to your situation and then) run this tool from whatever path you like

	php build_configs.php

3) Use Gas Mask.app to create entries in your hosts file (copying from ~/github/tipi/public/hosts)

4) Restart apache (sudo apachectl restart -or- toggle System Preferences >> Web Sharing )

-- Expert mode --

5) Use the 'Gas Mask.app' Remote feature and point it to 'http://tipi.local/hosts'
